	<h1>Michael McClurkin, MD, MPP</h1>
	<p>I am a postdoctoral fellow in MITâ€™s Political Science Department, a research affiliate with the Center for the Governance of AI at the University of Oxford, and a fellow at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University. My current research focuses on the governance of artificial intelligence (AI). In particular, I study public and elite opinion toward AI and how the American welfare state could adapt to the increasing automation of labor. My previous research covered a wide range of topics, including the politics of the U.S. welfare state, attitudes towards climate change, and survey methodology. My papers have been published in Political Analysis, Nature Climate Change, the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research, and JAMA Surgery. My research and graduate education have been funded by the National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship, the Yale Institution for Social and Policy, and the Ethics and Governance of Artificial Intelligence Fund. I graduated with a BA in political science (2013) and an MA in statistics (2015) from Yale University. During graduate school, I worked as a data scientist for the Yale Program for Climate Change Communication and a researcher to former Secretary of State John Kerry.</p>
